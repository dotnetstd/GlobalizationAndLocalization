# DbLocalizationProvider v5.0
===================================================

Might be annoying to see this file all the time (even after minor version upgrade), but it's worth reading sometimes.

This is the 5th generation of the library and there are couple breaking changes.
Please lookup to this GitHub page about v5.0 new stuff (https://github.com/valdisiljuconoks/LocalizationProvider/blob/master/docs/v5.md).

Thanks for support and happy localizing!
